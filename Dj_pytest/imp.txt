to install pytest

pip install pytest

pip install pytest

1) create a folder tests in the root directory
    create a file called test_ex1.pytest
        inside the file write the test cases you want to test the django application.

2) create pytest.ini in the django_root directory
        in the pytest.ini file write down the following lines of code so that tha django.settings will accept the pytest
            [pytest]
            DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = core.settings

            python_files =  test_*.py 

3) To run the tests

    come to the termainal
        and locate the path to the tests folder we have already created.
             then type the following command pytest test_ex1.py.
                 (test_ex1.py is the file we have already created in the tests folder, to run the django-testing codes.)

test_ex1.py ..

these two dots indicate that two test has been sucessfully verified. 
for running individual tests

        this test_example is a test function inside the test_ex1.py

        mock is actually adding meta data to a test.
